# Breather
a custom guided breathing app designed & developed by sophia and april :)


## setup
- set up Node 12 LTS or greater on your system
- use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility (what we use to dynamically reload our application and view live changes - either via a phone simulator or your phone itself (you will need the expo app on your phone))
- Use this [reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.60/enviroment-setup) - but you do not need to 'init' another project, just enter the correct directory and type 'npm start'
